MY PORTFOLIO

My portfolio is a site dedicated to promoting my skills to future employers or clients. I detail my experience in the communication field and my future technical skills as a Full Stack Software Developer. It is possible to contact me via a contact form, by phone or by email, as well as via LinkedIn.

I can add an image on a div with a value "auto" for height. The picture doesn't appear. It is not working either with a % value. It's working just with a px value.

TO COPY AGAIN ON THE REAL/MAIN README DOCUMENT


to center my background-color on the picture, I use the code "how to center vertically and horizontaly" from W3schools.com 
Add a position relative to the section parent
Add a position absolute to the child div, add values for top and left, add an attribute transform with values, put margin to 0

Fixed errors
Error with the h2 child of spans. I deleted the span and I replace them by a div.

I have a horizontaly scroolbar, all my sections are with "width:100%". I add the attribute "max-width:100%" to the nav and footer.
