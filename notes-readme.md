TO COPY AGAIN ON THE REAL/MAIN README DOCUMENT


to center my background-color on the picture, I use the code "how to center vertically and horizontaly" from W3schools.com 
Add a position relative to the section parent
Add a position absolute to the child div, add values for top and left, add an attribute transform with values, put margin to 0

Fixed errors
Error with the h2 child of spans. I deleted the span and I replace them by a div.

I have a horizontaly scroolbar, all my sections are with "width:100%". I add the attribute "max-width:100%" to the nav and footer.
